# 1 Functional tests
The below test plans are implemented in Test.java in my test package

# 2 Requirements

## 2.1  

| **Requirement code: OR01, OR03, OR04, OR06** |       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Description**      | OR01-Structured data model that is capable of storing, retrieving, OR03-Graphical interface for outliner, OR04-Appropriate OO design, OR06-adding a new section to the outline.  | 
| **Pre-condition**     | a CSV file, a working Section, Outliner, and DataAccess class|      
| **Post-condition**      | A Section Object instantiated, Added to the Outliner ArrayList<Section> section attribute which will be reflected on the Outliner_view graphical user interface  | 
| **Design notes**     | This functionality to add a new section also stores to persistent storage at the same time so the result of adding a new section should also reflect on the csv file 
| **Parameters**      | `Outliner.addSection(Section newSection)`|    
| **Step sequence**      |  |
||1. Instantiate a new Section object->`Section newSection = new Section(0,"New section Text")`|
||2. Call the Outliner Function to add new Section->`Outliner.addSection(newSection)` | 
||3. Generate new string view with this new Section Object added to the ArrayList&lt;Section&gt; section| 
||4. Use the string view generated by the Outliner when instantiating a JTextArea component on my graphical user interface  |
| **Success**      | A new Section Object is instantiated |
||1. With the correct id attribute|
||2. This Section Object is added to the ArrayList&lt;Section&gt; which is used to generate a string view|
||3. This string view is used to update the JTextArea component in my Graphical user interface|
| **Tests**      |  Testing adding a new Section Object to the outline |
||1. Testing if a new section is instantiated and added to the Outline ArrayList&lt;Section&gt; and is reflected on the JTextArea on my Graphical interface |
||    With this method in my Tests class `Tests.testAddNewSection()` | 
||2. Test if my new Section Object was assigned a correct id attribute by its constructor| 
||   With this method `Tests.testSectionConstructorIdAllocation()` | 
| **Errors**      | Issues that may be encountered |
||1. Some development code might cause an error|
||2. Some assumption might be incorrect|
||3. Some operation might fail|
||4. Some more tests... `testName and signature`|
| **Alternative Flows**      | How exceptions/errors are handled or special cases |
||1. A normal condition is not met what then?|
||2. This is the first time the application has been run..|
||3. More edge cases....|
