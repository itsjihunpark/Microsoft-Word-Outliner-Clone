# 1 Functional tests
The below test plans are implemented in Test.java in my test package

# 2 Requirements

## 2.1  

| **Requirement code: OR01, OR03, OR04, OR06** |       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Description**      | OR01-Structured data model that is capable of storing, retrieving, OR03-Graphical interface for outliner, OR04-Appropriate OO design, OR06-adding a new section to the outline.  | 
| **Pre-condition**     | a CSV file, a working Section, Outliner, and DataAccess class|      
| **Post-condition**      | A Section Object instantiated, Added to the Outliner ArrayList<Section> section attribute which will be reflected on the Outliner_view graphical user interface  | 
| **Design notes**     | This functionality to add a new section also stores to persistent storage at the same time so the result of adding a new section should also reflect on the csv file 
| **Parameters**      | `Outliner.addSection(Section newSection)`|    
| **Step sequence**      |  Step-by-step breakdown to accomplish requirement |
||1. Perform an operation|
||2. In one case do this | 
||3. In another do this | 
||4. In then do this |
| **Success**      | Criterion of success |
||1. This is the case|
||2. And this.... |
||3. etc.... |
| **Tests**      |  Brainstorm of basic tests to verify functionality |
||1. Test an operation is completed |
||2. Test result in one case | 
||3. Test result in another case | 
||4. More tests for expected outcomes | 
| **Errors**      | Issues that may be encountered |
||1. Some development code might cause an error|
||2. Some assumption might be incorrect|
||3. Some operation might fail|
||4. Some more tests... `testName and signature`|
| **Alternative Flows**      | How exceptions/errors are handled or special cases |
||1. A normal condition is not met what then?|
||2. This is the first time the application has been run..|
||3. More edge cases....|
