# 1 Sub-Heading

An example Markdown functional test plan template.Perhaps some explanatory text about the application could go here with links if required.
[Info about Markdown](https://markdown.land/) 

You can put your requirement breakdown in tables. Markdown tables are quite basic but by using `<br>` tags for new lines, extra rows with or without numbered lists, and `code` , *italics* or **bold** you can get a reasonable result. 

The plan can then be version managed and incremental changes shown in gitlab commits. You can then develop the plan incrementally as you go and get full credit for it at the end of your development.  
ps Outside of tables a *new-line* can be inserted without a `<br>` tag - by putting two spaces before a carriage return e.g. as for this line.

## 2.1 Requirement 1

| **R1** |   **Structured data Model-Storing/Retrieving data(UML)**    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | 
| **Description**      | Describes the requirement in more detail  | 
| **Pre-condition**     | Requirements prior to entry   |      
| **Post-condition**      | Promise to deliver upon exit   | 
| **Design notes**     | Any notes on use <br> Notes in cells can be put on separate lines using `<br>` or more rows eg... |
||1. numbered or unnumbered list of notes |
|| 2. and another... code can be included `Some code or Classname`  | 
|| 3. more.... |
| **Parameters**      | If needed with code `method(int param1, Thing param2)` |    
| **Step sequence**      |  Step-by-step breakdown to accomplish requirement |
||1. Perform an operation|
||2. In one case do this | 
||3. In another do this | 
||4. In then do this |
| **Success**      | Criterion of success |
||1. This is the case|
||2. And this.... |
||3. etc.... |
| **Tests**      |  Brainstorm of basic tests to verify functionality |
||1. Test an operation is completed |
||2. Test result in one case | 
||3. Test result in another case | 
||4. More tests for expected outcomes | 
| **Errors**      | Issues that may be encountered |
||1. Some development code might cause an error|
||2. Some assumption might be incorrect|
||3. Some operation might fail|
||4. Some more tests... `testName and signature`|
| **Alternative Flows**      | How exceptions/errors are handled or special cases |
||1. A normal condition is not met what then?|
||2. This is the first time the application has been run..|
||3. More edge cases....|
